Challenges of collaboration
--
> Camilla
Oslo: cool GUI
Bergen: more text based analysis
- people not willing to share code,
obfuscate code as result
- national genome center -> make it happen
- TBs of data
- need access card to access data
- What if you upload something by a mistake (github)?
- heptic data
- dev containers with git
  
> Andreas
Dream about national HPC system

> Laura
How to make data collaboration safe?
- keep in mind dream scenario!
- solution: publish
-   include data that was used
-   remaining data just disregarded
-   

> Olav
Solution: Separate data from code
Git history
- What liscense?
